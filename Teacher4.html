   <h1>Maya Angelou</h1>

   <p>Passion in Poetry Before Maya Angelou became the powerful poet and civil rights activist the world remembers her as she suffered a life of torment and darkness that nearly stole her voice forever. At a very young age, she was forced to endure intense physical and emotional abuse at the hands of a family member. As a result, she became mute for nearly five years. It all changed one day with the help of a family friend, a teacher named Bertha Flowers. Angelou credited Mrs. Flowers for helping her find her own voice again. Through Flowers, she was introduced to African-American female artists like Frances Harper, Anne Spencer, and Jessie Fauset. In addition, Mrs. Flowers introduced Angelou to Dickens, Shakespeare, Poe, and several other prolific writers who would come to greatly influence her personal and professional philosophies</p>
