   <h1>Piyush Kant Maav Piyush - Udacity</h1>

   <p>
    UdacityPiyush always knew he wanted to be a coder, but it seemed an unlikely goal. His father worked in a local garment shop as a salesman, making just enough to feed the family. But Piyush was undaunted. He believed he had what it takes, and that there were opportunities for him out there somewhere. He started learning basic programming skills online in a local cybercafé. He was a quick study, and launched his first website when he was in Class 10th. He had high hopes as far as getting into a great college, but an unforeseen family crisis depleted what little money they had, and Piyush had to settle for a local engineering college. He was able to learn a bit more, but quickly ran short on the resources he really needed to advance his skills. When he discovered the Google Developer Scholarship, he knew it was the chance he’d been dreaming of. Since earning the scholarship, his work ethic has impressed everyone, and he has earned a reputation as being one of this most active contributors in the Front-End Developer track of the Google Scholarship. Become a front-end developer in 4 months.
